This repository is based on the demo code on a dynamic widget translation from Chapter 11 of the Cross-Platform Development with Qt6 and Modern C++ book. The original code can be downloaded from [url=https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Cross-Platform-Development-with-Qt-6-and-Modern-Cpp/tree/master/Chapter11/WidgetTranslationDemo]here[/url]. The code in there has been slightly modified to include a comboBox to show some strings to represent colors.
